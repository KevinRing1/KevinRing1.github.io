<p>If your service crew is already busy with the rest of your equipment, don't load them up with even more equipment to maintain. The lift truck market value and volume are contributed by the revenue and the forklift truck units sold across North America, Asia Pacific, Middle-East Africa and Latin America.

Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load.
