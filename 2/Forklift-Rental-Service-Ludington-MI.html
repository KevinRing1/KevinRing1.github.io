From electric pallet jacks to narrow aisle lift trucks or sit-down rider forklifts, we'll help you find exactly what you need and get it to your facility when you need it.

This is highlighted by the impressive load capacity: Our low-level order pickers, for instance, can lift up to three pallets weighing up to 2.5 tons with their 2.4 metre long forks.

Whether you have seasonal business, a temporary increase in workload, or are taking on a special project with a definite endpoint, leasing a forklift is probably the way to go. And the money you save by leasing can be put into what matter most: growing the business.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The new Toyota high capacity reach forklifts are developed for intensive stacking applications focusing on productivity, reliability, ergonomics (controls, steering and seat adapted to the driver's needs) and most importantly safety.</p>

Load-reach management devices can automatically restrict the reach of the forklift based on the load being handled rather than relying on the operator.</p>
