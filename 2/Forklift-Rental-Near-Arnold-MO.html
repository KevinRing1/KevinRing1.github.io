The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load. Popular brands of standup forklifts include Yale, Crown, Baker, Hyster, and Raymond, which range in price from as little as $5,000 used to as much as $35,000 for a fully equipped new machine. Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point.</p>

With the test load supported by the forks in a normal and unrestrained manner, elevate the load to the maximum height at which unrestrained, horizontal travel is permitted.</p>
<h2>Solutions For Electrical Contractors Arnold </h2>

The truck class always sees a wide variety of entries due to a thriving community of truck enthusiasts with a broad palate for styling designs; from some of the lowest frame draggers you'll ever see to skyjacker lifts that seem to touch the sky. Double-Deep trucks are similar, but with longer forks, making them perfect for areas where multiple pallet loads are stored in each bay as they will reach right to the back of the bay.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for these tests, a truck shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 14 per cent slope for loaded truck (Test #N5), and a 14 percent or 18 percent slope for unloaded truck (Test #N5A), depending on whether the truck has single rear-wheel drive (or brake) or dual rear-wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.</p>
