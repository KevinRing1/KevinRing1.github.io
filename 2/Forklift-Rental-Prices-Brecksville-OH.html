The following tests represent minimum stability requirements for order picker trucks with traction control on the lifting device, and not restrained by external means, having rated capacities up to and including 10,000 pounds at a 24 inch load center.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

A lifted truck has its suspension raised and may have its engine modified to be louder, creating a true white trash experience. Constructed with either internal combustion engines or electric motors, reach trucks come in three main types: straddle reach trucks, standup reach trucks or double deep reach trucks.</p>
<p>Ohio Power Tool carries a wide selection of jack stands (truck air jack stands, vehicle support jack stands, forklift jack stands, pin-type jack stands, and truck ramps) that offer capacities of 3-25 tons. Unlike most car repairs or upgrades, lifting a truck requires a little more effort than getting a few gearhead friends together on a Sunday afternoon to gather around a toolbox and a twelve-pack.</p>
