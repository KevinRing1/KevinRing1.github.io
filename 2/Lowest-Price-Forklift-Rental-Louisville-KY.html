<p>Lift Code 4: Three Wheel Electric Trucks, Sit Down. It was fun driving different types of sit down forklifts. On new forklifts we offer up to 72 months of either a $1 buyout or a True FMV lease option. Cushion-tired lifts tend to ride lower to the ground than pneumatic-tired forklifts, making this type of forklift well-suited to low-clearance situations. Different types of tyres are available for forklifts. According to a TICO representative, the materials handling equipment market as a whole continued to expand globally due mainly to increases in unit sales in Europe and North America as well as a recovery in China, although unit sales in Japan were on par with the previous fiscal year.</p>
