The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.

Rough terrain poses additional threats and risks to the operators of forklifts. However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want. They have been renting out equipment for over 50 years.</p>

Some forklifts use a single hydraulic cylinder to elevate the boom, while others use two cylinders.
