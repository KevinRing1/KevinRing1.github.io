<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>Every year nearly 100 workers are killed and 20,000 are seriously injured in forklift mishaps. Telescopic forward reach allows you to unload lorries from one side so no forklift movement around the other side of the lorry is required, ensuring pedestrians stay safe and separate.
