You typically gain 1-3 inches of ground clearance with a suspension lift kit. Also referred to as a "warehouse forklift," this truck is designed to work indoors on flat ground.

<p>We bring forth our vast industrial experience and expertise in this business, instrumental in providing Forklift Truck. Rough terrain forklifts are used for areas that need the maximum amount of traction to transport inventory safely.

With no mast blocking the view ahead like on conventional forklifts, the Teletruk's unique side boom provides unrivalled forward visibility.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these rough terrain forklifts double as workhorses in the bush here in Australia. The test load should be equivalent to an unrestrained, homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension, and should equal in weight to the rated capacity of the truck. Similar to a reach truck, the electric variety is only for indoor use.</p>
