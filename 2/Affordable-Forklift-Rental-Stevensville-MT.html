As order pickers are mostly operated at elevated heights, it is important that operators are properly trained on maneuvering and safety of these trucks.</p>
<p>The goal of the course is to help small businesses become self-sufficient regarding forklift operator training (upon successfully attending the class, individuals are certified to train fellow workers at their own place of employment). The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>
<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up.
