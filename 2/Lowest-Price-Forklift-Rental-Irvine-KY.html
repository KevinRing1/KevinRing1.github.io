Agria forklifts are fitted with industry leading Deutz or Perkins diesel engines to provide the extra power necessary to operate over rough terrain whilst carrying heavy loads.</p>

More importantly, we provide every one of the products and services that you require to oversee and care for your fork lifts.</p>
