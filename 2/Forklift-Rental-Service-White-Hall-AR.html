Berry Material Handling carries new Load Lifter rough terrain forklift models for a variety of applications. 7 Each unit is started and run through a series of functional tests with actual loads for up to 1.5 hours.

The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.
