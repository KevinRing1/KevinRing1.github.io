Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>

That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
