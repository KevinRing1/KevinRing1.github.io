<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. Keep these statistics in mind while training workers and safely operating forklifts. This additional clearance requires installing larger tires and in order to do that, you need to get everything up off the ground more.

Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>

Forklift rentals are not inexpensive.</p>

Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.</p>
<p>When you see the selection of 4x4 conversion trucks at Laura Buick GMC, you'll be confident that you should make one of these trucks your next vehicle purchase. It is at this point of rebound that big lifted trucks are likely to crash or flip, because it can be difficult to control the bouncing.
