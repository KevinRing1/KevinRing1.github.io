<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. The forklift's AC system features precise speed control, quickly adapts to varying conditions, and varies output for continued, consistent operation. This is a person we would never invite to a party; a person whose lifted truck parked outside a restaurant we were considering would cause us to eat somewhere else.

These forklifts feature a simple, cost-effective Tier 4 Final solution.</p>
<p>3-wheel counterbalance forklift trucks are similar to 4-wheel counterbalance machines. When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials. The redesign includes modifying the forklift chain and the mast inner channel to create a wider window creating better visibility. The lift trucks are used to unload, lift, lower and stack pallet loads, or other bulk loads into storage and transportation racks and facilities.</p>
<p>Order picker forklifts are usually powered by electric motors because they don't generate noxious fumes.
