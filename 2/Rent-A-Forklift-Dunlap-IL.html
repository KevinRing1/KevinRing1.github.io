They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

Often called a tugger,” these versatile machines are most commonly used for pulling loads from Point A to Point B rather than lifting.</p>

Select a forklift rental plan that meets your immediate needs, whether short- or long-term.</p>
<p>The Forklift Network has 170 dealers across North America including Canadian Provinces, and has thousands of used electric forklifts for sale. The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it. The name comes from the counterweight in the rear of the vehicle. If you have any other questions about counterbalance or reach forklifts or would like any advice regarding finding the ideal forklift for you, then please contact PHL today We offer support and have a huge range of stock to suit your every need.</p>

They handle different sizes of loads and are engineered to perfection.</p>

Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
