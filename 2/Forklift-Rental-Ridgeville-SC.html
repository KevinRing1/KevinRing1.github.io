PA Industrial Equipment has an extensive selection of high quality, dependable, economical used forklifts. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load at maximum elevation shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a slope of 4 percent about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
