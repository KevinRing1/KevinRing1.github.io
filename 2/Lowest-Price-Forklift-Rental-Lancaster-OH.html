Not move the truck and remain at the controls at all times, if operating an industrial lift truck with a forklift platform with an employee on the platform. For trucks with tilting forks, the forks shall be horizontal or at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable. If you work in a job that requires you to use a forklift primarily outdoors on natural or uneven terrain, even occasionally or rarely, you need rough terrain forklift training.</p>
<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>
