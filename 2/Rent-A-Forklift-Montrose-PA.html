<p>This course is designed to provide experienced operators with relevant knowledge and understanding of practical use of the Industrial Counterbalance Forklift. Gas forklifts constantly need to be refilled, so the recurring need to purchase fuel makes the long-term costs hefty. If you are a forklift operator, be sure to fasten your seat belt before moving the equipment. They're the most common type of cargo transport truck in stores, but they're also popular in warehouses and distribution centers, too. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical or at full rearward till, whichever is less stable.</p>
<p>Non-serious injuries related to forklift accidents reach 61,800 each year in the USA. In my region, paper mills call them tow motors,” warehouses may refer to them as stackers,” and builders tend to use telehandlers” in lieu of rough terrain forklifts.” OSHA uses the all-encompassing phrase powered industrial trucks,” or PITs, when referring to forklifts in its 1910.178 standard.</p>

While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts.
