<p>Aside from these two distinct types of a forklift, there are many other varieties available. Reach forklifts, also known as reach trucks, get their names from the distinctive way in which their fork carriages can â€˜reach' into racking. Low noise and vibration, excellent all-round visibility and easy servicing allow for improved driver comfort and forklift truck durability.</p>

Generally speaking the reach truck will be less expensive new, used or leased than a sit-down forklift but the real value is in increased warehouse productivity. At United Equipment, we offer a wide range of Cat and Elevah order pickers for sale, the ideal pickers for high, narrow or tricky-to-navigate spaces.</p>
