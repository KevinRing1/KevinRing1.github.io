<p>Look no further to get behind the wheel of a premier, high-quality lifted truck today. Berry Material Handling carries new Load Lifter rough terrain forklift models for a variety of applications. 7 Each unit is started and run through a series of functional tests with actual loads for up to 1.5 hours. The same is applicable for forklift trucks too.

<p>The G2 features a 4 inch elevated off road suspension lift, custom G2 wheels, and 33 inch all-terrain tires. Included in this class are lift trucks with 3 or 4 wheels and either cushion (solid) or pneumatic (air filled) tires. Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup.</p>
<p>Rough-terrain forklifts with telescopic booms are a unique category offering longer horizontal reach, and some models can swivel a full 360 degrees for improved maneuverability. While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts. As the fork lift trucks are usually quite expensive, many industry enterprises choose to buy used forklifts on industrial auctions, which reduces the cost of the process they implement.</p>
