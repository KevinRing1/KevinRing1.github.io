<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>

<p>Owning your own fleet of forklifts means you need to spend time and money maintaining them. Four fixed-fork order pickers are ideally suited for picking bulky, oversized items or where extended platforms and industrial carts are used in place of pallets.
