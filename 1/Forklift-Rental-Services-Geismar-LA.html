Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity.</p>
<h2>Used Pallet Truck Geismar</h2>
<p>Newer forklifts are easier to rent. The rear end of the forklift swings in a circle around the front wheels that support most of the load. Liftking has a diverse product offering, ranging from a variety of RT forklift configurations, to application-specific custom forklifts, to heavy-duty transporters.

<p>While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet. As already mentioned, choosing a forklift with the right handling capacity is therefore essential. Forklifts come in a variety of shapes and sizes to do various jobs. You'll often see these forklifts traveling down the highway on the back of semi-truck trailers.</p>

Similar to a reach truck, the electric variety is only for indoor use.</p>
