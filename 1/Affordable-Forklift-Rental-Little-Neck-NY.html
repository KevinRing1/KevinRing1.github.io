There are many attachments that can be purchased to go along with used rough terrain forklifts.</p>
<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>

A forklift is any mechanical device, powered by an electric motor or internal combustion engine that is used to move or lift loads. In fact, most body lift kits are designed to work with suspension lift kits.
