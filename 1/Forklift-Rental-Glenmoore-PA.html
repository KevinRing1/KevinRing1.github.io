<p>Experience the difference CASE Forklifts can make for you and your business. Like any other lift truck, the electric variation is used to lift and transport materials for short distances. Download our Rental Equipment Brochure , or browse our rental equipment below. According to Fortune Business Insights, the lift truck market is expected to reach 2,242.1 Thousand Units in 2026.</p>
<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup. Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures.</p>
<h2>Used Electric Pallet Jack Glenmoore</h2>
<p>In addition, one should always check the capacity plate as it gives important information for how heavy a load the forklift can handle, as well as information about the tires, tilt degrees and other knowledge necessary to safe operating. A loading plate for loading reference is usually located on the forklift. The type of load also matters as there are specific forklift attachments that can enhance a standard forklift and help you move the load more efficiently.</p>
