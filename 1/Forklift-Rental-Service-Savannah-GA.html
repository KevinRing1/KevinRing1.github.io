<p>Looking to rent material handling equipment in Phoenix? Cargo type - You need to consider factors like the packaging of your cargo, the type of pallets used, and whether or not the load has a unique shape. Plus, their 8,000+ rental yards means there's probably one near you already. Since Rocky Ridge trucks can be hard to find at times, most drivers have numerous questions about these vehicles, from what the lift kits do to how much experience the company has.</p>
<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach” into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>

<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>
