<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>You must know how to safely load, unload, and drive a rough terrain forklift to prevent accidents and injuries. This is best if you have a large warehouse or need different types of lifts for the jobs you'll be doing. If you test drive your lifted trucks hurriedly, you will fail to pay close attention to some signs you should be watching out for. The Forklift Order Picker Cages have durable wire mesh backs and side panels and are to be used in conjunction with a body harness (for working at heights).</p>

<h3>Mini Forklift Truck Mission Viejo CA</h3>

There are other models that have an auxiliary mast that is mounted in front of the platform with pallet forks. We offer a full line of both new and used trucks, buses and trailers. Drive and operate your rental equipment safely. Batteries prevent the emission of harmful fumes and are recommended for facilities in which employees are in close proximity to forklifts in operation, food-processing and healthcare sectors.</p>

Also known as a straight mast forklift, the rough terrain forklift is designed specifically for outdoor job sites, especially on uneven surfaces.
