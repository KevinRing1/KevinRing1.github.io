Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers.

The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>
