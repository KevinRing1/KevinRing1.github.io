<p>Completing your training and receiving your certification will only enable you to drive that specific forklift truck â€” any additional trucks will require you to take an entirely new course. We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb.

It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend.
