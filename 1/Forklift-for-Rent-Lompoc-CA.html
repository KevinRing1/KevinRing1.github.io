On new forklifts we offer up to 72 months of either a $1 buyout or a True FMV lease option.

In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
