<p>Safety features of this forklift truck include a high-visibility overhead guard, an emergency power disconnect switch, electric horn, and an anti-static ground strap. Manual pallet jacks have existed since at least 1918. Heavy loads and the shifting center-of-gravity can tip a forklift over if it goes too fast. For intricate indoor operations, reach forklift trucks can provide drivers with another set of eyes when they are handling a robust inventory.</p>
<p>The M-series reach trucks have a narrow chassis design and 360° steering, this makes them ideal for material operations like block stacking, drive-in racking and other confined areas. A typical telescoping-boom rough terrain forklift is long and low with a pair of wheels at the extreme front and another pair located towards the rear. Actually, this pallet jack operates simi-electronically, and it works best for transporting and lifting tasks.</p>
